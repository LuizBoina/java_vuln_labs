# Java Vulnerable Labs (Public Repo)
A collection of vulnerable applications developed using SpringBoot. The objective of this collection is to test your web pentesting skills, identify vulnerabilities in code and fix it.

Some of this labs was developed based on [sfk-labs](https://skf.gitbook.io/asvs-write-ups).

To start any lab you can start it using the following command (inside the case folder): `./mvnw spring-boot:run -s ./settings.xml -nsu -DskipTests `
or
just use the following command: make folder-name (ie: make csrf to run the csrf case)
